# Google Search Frontend Clone
This project is a simple replication of the Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search interfaces. It was developed as part of the CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript course. This front-end clone allows users to perform searches using Google's search engine via a custom interface.

## Features
Google Search: A custom front-end for Google's standard search.
Google Image Search: A custom interface to perform searches on Google Images.
Google Advanced Search: An interface that allows users to perform more refined searches using Google's advanced search parameters.

## Pages
```index.html```: The main Google Search page.
```image_search.html```: The Google Image Search page.
```advanced_search.html```: The Google Advanced Search page.

## Usage
To use this project, simply open the ```index.html``` file in a web browser. You will see a search bar that you can use to perform standard Google searches. In the upper-right corner of the page, there are links to navigate to the Image Search or Advanced Search pages. On each of these pages, you can perform the respective types of searches.

The Advanced Search page allows input for specific search criteria, such as searching for pages with all given words, an exact phrase, any of the listed words, or none of the listed words.

Additionally, there is an "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on the main Google Search page that takes users directly to the first search result, bypassing the normal results page.

## Getting Started
Download the project files from the provided link, unzip them, and open ```index.html``` in a browser to start using the front-end.
